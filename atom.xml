    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The transcript of Value of Values by Rich Hickey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BsiVyC1kM&amp;amp;list=PLRZ9CBXkZGmPtdCa8veT_fa5auxuI-BKi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the value of values, who here works in IT.&lt;br&gt;What is that mean? What is it stand for IT?&lt;br&gt;Information technology. SO what do we mean when we say information? As you may know for my other keynoted, all I want to make my&lt;br&gt;kwynotes my dictionary, is my dictionary has all the answers. My dictionary says information is base on the word inform, which means&lt;br&gt;to convey knowledge via facts and the purpose of that is to give shape to the mind. And information is just those facts.That is what&lt;br&gt;information is. Information is fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is a fact? A fact is the place where information store. And what is great about that is there is a place for every piece of information.&lt;br&gt;And facts are operations, like get and set and you may have other operations. And those operation control how facts can change.&lt;br&gt;The other great things about fact is it’s easy to convey them.To convey a fact is just convey its location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many people are uncomfortable right now? I am, this is not true right? This is wrong. Everything I just said is wrong.Dead wrong,&lt;br&gt;and you should be uncomfortable.This is not the facts are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So our facts are places,well, what’s the place? Again back to the dictionary, a place is a particular portion of space. And the space is a more&lt;br&gt;important word, we gonna dig into later.And in particular the part of the place that matters are the fact it’s sort of delimited. right? There is&lt;br&gt;the specificity to location, name via place or vice versa. And we know about places, we have good examples of places of everyday work in progarming.&lt;br&gt;Memory address are places, disk sector are places. Addresses, we can go to them, substitude their contents with other contents.And we are very familiar with&lt;br&gt;this notion of place. And i think it’s quite  important to think about whether or not with this memory address in this location we are actually building&lt;br&gt;the information systems that earn about information we just find it. ??&lt;br&gt;In particluar, we use memory and we use objects, typically, specially at this contents. And mutable objects are nothing more than abstraction over places.&lt;br&gt;their little abstraction over places. Specially, well in partically the mutable objects.and they have methods just like the thing I talk before about fact.&lt;br&gt;having methods object have methods. And this is the core thing we are building systems on it. On the other side, on the durably side, we have same kind of notion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we have tables documents, records, all of them have the places. all of them have update inotaion, the notion of going into the place and set it into a value .&lt;br&gt;These are undependings from which we build systems. but we are sort of making abstraction on top of them.But don’t hide what they are about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have word for this or term for this, I call it PLOP, Plaec oriented programming.Which is what this is. And you can tell what’s going on.Because everytime the new&lt;br&gt;information replace old information.You are doing the place oriented programming.There are reasons we are doing the place-oriented programming. Because way back the&lt;br&gt;early days of computers, we have to do place oriented programming. I saw a guy stills gave a great talk is talking about working you konw, building the great system&lt;br&gt;on computer that have 4 kilo words of memory.And every piece of memory, you knew the address, she know the even number of memory started at 2000 or use for jump table.&lt;br&gt;The number of the address here are use for data And other part of the memory here are use for code.Sometimes it used for more than one thing, for example, right now,&lt;br&gt;no one use this for code we can use it for data, vise versa. You have to do it. right, there isn’t enough compacity to do anything else. Computer memory is really small.&lt;br&gt;dist is very small.everything is very expensive, so we adopt it an approach to programming that was base around the manipulation of palces, totally make sense. And the keyword,&lt;br&gt;they are in the key aspect it make sense, it used to make sense, those limitations are gone. In the time I’ve been doing the programming, the capacity of these two have&lt;br&gt;increase a million faults. A MILLION FAULTS.What other thing in life, you know, have the same fact about it?Remain true when the sidzes of something change by a million fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic trick call was million times bigger than this. What rules would still be applyed?What characters would still be true?&lt;br&gt;But yet, we are retaining decision that make thing much much smaller. And moving forward with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is PLOP still rules? The key question here.Right? we are talking about the Place-oriented programming, we often talk about the two things, memory and records.&lt;br&gt;these have meanning before we have computer, and we are taking them over. We said, memory means addresses in RAM chips, records mean you konw slots in database’s tables. And worse&lt;br&gt;than just taken over these words, coz obviously there is limitions to these words in the analogies roughly whole,right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems is we’ve now been doing this for so long. We believe that our own myths about what this is mean. But we should go back to the fact of memory of method right?The fact&lt;br&gt;of memory is that it’s open system.If your friend gets a new email address, right? that doesn’t go into your brain.And find your friend’s email address cell and replace the email&lt;br&gt;address in that part you konw that’s no runs??? in your brain. that’s not how brains work.that’s not how memory works. Memory essentially and open system, and associated system.&lt;br&gt;it is not an addressed base system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thing, record keeping. We use to keep record before we have computers. What do we do?You know we took out the stone tablet and chew all the things,&lt;br&gt;we took out the pepile and wrote things down. When we have new information, what do we do?We didn’t go and l?et smooth over the marble and choose the new stuff. We didnt’ go the prepiles? and&lt;br&gt;take out a racers and things like that. People build and accounting systems, they didn’t use the racer either. What they use double entry ccounting, ledger based countting. They only&lt;br&gt;make correcting entries. They did not go back with the racers. Not the way things work before we had computers.So this talk is about values.7:27&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So another term we should define, And again, we just go back to the dictionary. There are some interesting definition for value. Right? First is relative worth. And relave is end up being very&lt;br&gt;critical aspect for values.right, because the next thing is the one we probally most familiar with the person computers. Right, coz this next definition is the one applies to like 42 right. it’s&lt;br&gt;a magnitude it’s a number. it’s something we use to measure somethign else. Nah notion of value, I think it’s the one we mostly readily able to adapt. And again, the bigger notion of value is about&lt;br&gt;meanning and comparability and about relative worth. That’s the bigger notion of value, because when you measure something, you have to measure in term of something else. It does absolute measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some the comparsion part is important, So the question right now is, is String a value? How many people give this?(raise the hand)  I love doing the answer the question by rasing the hands, but not everybody hvae&lt;br&gt;the hands, appearantly. How many people think string is not a value. How many people think it depends? You always wait for the depends ? right? that’s the best answer. You hold that for it.Right? what is&lt;br&gt;it depends on?&lt;br&gt;is it immutable ?right? if the string is mutable, it’s a value, if the string is immutable, it’s not a value.How many people work the programming language would still do what string is mutable?&lt;br&gt;How many people want to go back? No, we don’t like this.And it ends up that, this equality notion of value, coz right now, the string doesn’t measure something right ?It’s not manitude or amount, it doen’t&lt;br&gt;correspond to that definition.But it ends that the mutable string is a comparable thing. And comparability is where we derive our ability to do logic. and to make decisiio.And to we can say, is this&lt;br&gt;the same was yesterday ? is it greater or less than what it was ? Is the string label this thing correctly you know according to my understanding of it. Or anything we do, with information. That comparability and&lt;br&gt;equality test sort of bottom, now goes back to another notion of value. We really don’t want to go back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we want to sort of talk about the values, it’s not from the dictionaly definition.  but very  specifically, in term of what we do in programming. And there are lot’s of new answer to this spec de? the purpose&lt;br&gt;to this talk if giving it half an hour. I’m just gonna to focus on two, valuls are immutable, and values are semantically transparent. And the purpose of the values is it expose to you, so that you can do the&lt;br&gt;comparasion and equality test. Values is not about ecapsulate something into your method, and doing thing. The value is saying, compare me to something else.I’m telling you what my precise meaning and signicant is.&lt;br&gt;Significant is write on the label, write on the outside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the reason give this talk about is the value propositions of values. what makes values good.originally this talk is going to be an hour long , so this is gonna to be a little bit fast. But there’s bunch of characteristics&lt;br&gt;that the value are valuable.The first is the value can be shared. Right, if you have the value, you have the immutable thing. Can you give it to somebody else and not worry?Yes, you don’t have to worry. Do they have to&lt;br&gt;worry about you now , coz both of you are sharing the same value. Anybody have to worry?No. So the value can be shared, that’s very very valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value supports reproducible results. Right, if you define a function in terms of value. Everytime may call that function you get the same answer. Yes. if you define a fucntion in terms of places. Everytime you run that function&lt;br&gt;you will get same answer ? NO! Right? in terms of what’s is the place ? Right? reproducible result really matters.They allow you to run tests. And reproducible tests. How many people now runnig test now in places? They can’t&lt;br&gt;tell you anything. Can’t tell you anything, they all contional on your ability to bring that ‘place’ to the same place. To the same value. Another critical aspect to value is that they are easy to fabricate, you can make up&lt;br&gt;the values from scratch in any progaramming language quite readily. Can you make a string in any programming language? yes. Can you make a list of string? sure. list of number, yes ,list of list of numbers, a map of list of numbers.&lt;br&gt;yes. can I make it insance of your fancy interface in any other language?No, it’s not easy to fabracate that, it’s not easy to make programs that write programs. it’s not easy to write program that write tests, if your progarms&lt;br&gt;are not based around values. So the fact that those are easy to fabricate is important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, values are language independent.So I just talk about that already. The notion of string or number or map.This has noting to do with the programming language. The thing I just said, nothing at all right?Nor any of the aggregate those&lt;br&gt;things have nothing to do with that. They are generic.These ideas, the notion of values are generic.And I think it’s somehing that we don’t thing about of another in our programming designed to our system, but the actual cost of specificity.&lt;br&gt;We love specificity, we use java every new idea gets a new class.Every new thing gets a new thing. What’s the cost that happen? You get this explosion of code  just a tremendous explosion of code.&lt;br&gt;obvious was worth suport revies the exact opposite thing especially in type languages. You get very little reuse coz you make a new thing every time.&lt;br&gt;And what is more code mean? More code equal more bugs. Another interesting thing about values is value are aggrigate to values. This is something I really want you to focus on. We talk about the 42, we talk about the string, we talk about the&lt;br&gt;atomic thing.But the list of immutable things. it’s itself and immutable thing, so on and so forth. As you build aggrigates, those bigger things are also values. And I think we tend to stop, we say of course strings to be immutable. But the&lt;br&gt;immutable collections, booo (no, I don’t want it), I can’t even comprehend it. But you should, right? It has all the same desirable attributes that the immutable string did. nobody here wants program with mutable strings anymore. Why do you&lt;br&gt;want program with mutable collections anymore. You shouldn’t. And is really important a benefits you get from doing this.For instance, compare to object if you have an object and you want to share, what do you have to do?  Right? just find the object&lt;br&gt;find the interface,  then you have to do what? What if in concurrent environment, what do you have to have to that object? Some sort of locking policy ? right? very very  difficulte thing in fact a lot of languages don’t give you any rsources to&lt;br&gt;define it well. But if you done that, and there’s also other kind of the problems, like how do you copy it? What is the cloning sematic? Once you done that work, you done that work for every of your classes.And now you build something that is composite&lt;br&gt;of those things. Do you get a lock policy for combinding them? No! It all falls away, you have do all over again. This composite for all these things for which I have lock policy, now no longer have a lock policy, I have to come up with the new one. has&lt;br&gt;come up the new cloning policy , and everything else do over again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values aggregates to values, all the benefits apply to aggregate. There are other benefits we get from aggregate, we see this all the time. Values are easy to convey. If I have a piece of information I think it’s useful. I can send you that values, and&lt;br&gt;I’ve know I have communicated to you what I was seeing, if I see something interesting and I communicate to you the place where I say what I actually convey to you?Nothing, not the information that’s for sure. Coz you go to that place, you saw totally&lt;br&gt;different thing than what I saw. It works in other way as well. When I wanna perceive something. If it’s a value I could take my time and look at it, right? especially for the set of values, right, if it’s composite thing. 16:58&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pretty classical DP problem. I didn’t figure it out last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Edit-Distance&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Edit-Distance&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Edit Distance&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Edit Distance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Insert a character&lt;br&gt;b) Delete a character&lt;br&gt;c) Replace a character&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a id=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Analysis&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Analysis&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Analysis&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the problem that conform to the characteristics of &lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Programming&lt;/strong&gt;, we need to figure out how to split a big problem into several smaller ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;state&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;transition&lt;/strong&gt; are the keys to solve the DP problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming we want to convert the word1 &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to word2 &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Obviously, it will take one step.&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the word1 &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to word2 &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;c&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, it will also take only one step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about convert &lt;code&gt;ab&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;? Well, from prev conversion we know the minimum step is &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt;. And the last character of word1 equals to word2’s last character. So that means we don’t need to do anything. The answer is still one.&lt;br&gt;What if the word1 is &lt;code&gt;ab&lt;/code&gt; and word2 is &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;? The available substeps would be,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;ab&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;c&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;ab&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;c&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each substep we can get the answer base on the previous sub-answers.(The transition from &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;c&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; or from &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the empty character.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for longer string word1 &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; to word2 &lt;code&gt;bc&lt;/code&gt;, we can write down the 2D matrix blew,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;//the - stands for empty character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  - a b c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;- 0 1 2 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;b 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;c 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we know, from w1 to w2, it can be form in these sub-steps,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;w1.substring(0, w1.length - 1) and w2.substring(0, w2.length - 1) =&amp;gt; w1 and w2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;w1 and w2.substring(0, w2.length - 1) =&amp;gt; w1 and w2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;w1.substring(0, w1.length - 1) and w2 =&amp;gt; w1 and w2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we choose the minimum sub-steps everytime then we will be able to write down the pseudo code below,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;if (w1.charAt(i) == w2.charAt(j)) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125; else &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i][j - 1]) + 1;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Insert a character&lt;br&gt;b) Delete a character&lt;br&gt;c) Replace a character&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting question and it have a bunch of corner cases that we need to consider. (It takes me more than 5 hours to solve it at the first time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Candy&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Candy&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Candy&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Candy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each child must have at least one candy.&lt;br&gt;Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.&lt;br&gt;What is the minimum candies you must give?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a id=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Analysis&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Analysis&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Analysis&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a word, the higher rating value you get than your neighbors, the more candies you should get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the rating array below,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;[1, 2, 3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the output should be &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;. This is because the first child have 1 candy, and the next should have 2 candies according to his rating value. It’s easy to get the value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about two child are getting same rating value? For example, for &lt;code&gt;[1, 2, 2, 2]&lt;/code&gt; the right answer is &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important thing in solving this problem is, we want to give the minimum candies. This means each time we get a peek rating value, the next child can only have 1 candy until we meet the third child whose rating value is lower than the 2nd one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the array below,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;ratings [1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;   i     0  1  2  3  4  5  6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we meet the first child(i: 0). We give only 1 candy to him. So now our &lt;code&gt;totalCandies&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;And then the second, the third child we can just simply repeat the same process. Then we update our &lt;code&gt;totalCandies&lt;/code&gt; in this way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt; ratings     [1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    i         0  1  2  3  4  5  6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;totalCandies  1  3  6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we meet the 4th child(i: 3), because we know the previous child have the same rating value, so we can simply give only one candy to this child. And then we update our &lt;code&gt;totalCandies&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt; ratings     [1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    i         0  1  2  3  4  5  6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;totalCandies  1  3  6  7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We meet the 5th child now(i: 4), we can give only 1 candies to him, but we need to give the previous child one more candy for compensation. So update our &lt;code&gt;totalCandies&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt; ratings     [1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    i         0  1  2  3  4  5  6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  candy       1  2  3  2  1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;totalCandies  1  3  6  7  9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for compensation, another question to this is, when we should give one more candy to the peek child?(i: 2) Appearently when our candy gap is smaller than our position gap, we need to give one more candy for compensation. For example, when we meet the 6th child, our candy gap is &lt;code&gt;3 - 1 = 2&lt;/code&gt;, the position gap is &lt;code&gt;5 - 2 = 3&lt;/code&gt;. So at this moment, we need to &lt;code&gt;totalCandies++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt; ratings     [1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    i         0  1  2  3  4  5  6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  candy       1  2  4  3  2  1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;totalCandies  1  3  6  7  9  13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dependency Injection is kind of design pattern. Well, although it is not in the GOF’s design pattern list, but I think it is getting more and more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Why-we-need-Dependency-Injection&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Why-we-need-Dependency-Injection&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Why we need Dependency Injection?&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why we need Dependency Injection?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly let us think about why we need dependency injection. Suppose we have a function below,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;CoffeeMaker&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; grinder = &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Grinder();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; pump = Pump.getInstance();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; heater = app.get(&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;Heater&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.brew = &lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        grinder.grind();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        heater.on();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        pump.pump();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &amp;#125;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a good example, because the &lt;code&gt;CoffeeMaker&lt;/code&gt; is tightly couple to this particular environment, which means to use &lt;code&gt;CoffeeMaker&lt;/code&gt; we need to make sure we can get the &lt;code&gt;Grinder&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Pump&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Heater&lt;/code&gt; in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we just write down our code in one function, it’s not that kind of bad thing. How about in our project? Let’s me give u one more function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, definitely we get a main function looks like the code below,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; coffeeMaker = &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; CoffeeMaker();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    coffeeMaker.brew();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, if we want to test &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function, &lt;strong&gt;we need to make sure we have &lt;code&gt;CoffeeMaker&lt;/code&gt; in our environment.&lt;/strong&gt; Further more, we need to check &lt;code&gt;CoffeeMaker&lt;/code&gt;‘s code and &lt;strong&gt;we need to make sure all the things &lt;code&gt;CoffeeMaker&lt;/code&gt; depends on are exist.&lt;/strong&gt; In our example, they are &lt;code&gt;Grinder&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Pump&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Heater&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;main =&amp;gt; CoffeeMaker =&amp;gt; Grinder, Pump, Heater&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a word, to test &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function, we need to create &lt;code&gt;CoffeeMaker&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Grinder&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Pump&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Heater&lt;/code&gt; in our test environment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it, when our project getting bigger and bigger, we get a chance to have a controller or service which have more than 1000 lines. Are we still be able to maintain all these code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do it in a better way, let’s change our code into this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;CoffeeMaker&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;grinder, heater, pump&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.blew = &lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        grinder.grind();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        heater.on();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        pump.pump();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &amp;#125;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;coffeeMaker&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; injector = &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Injector();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; coffeeMaker = injector.get(CoffeeMaker);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    coffeeMaker.blew();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if we want to test main function, we just simply mock coffeMaker and make sure our &lt;code&gt;mockCoffeeMaker&lt;/code&gt; have the function &lt;code&gt;blew&lt;/code&gt;, that’s all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Create-Our-Own-Dependency-Injection-Component&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Create-Our-Own-Dependency-Injection-Component&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Create Our Own Dependency Injection Component&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Create Our Own Dependency Injection Component&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, this is how angular DI works in angular 1.x; For next generation, they are going to use annotation to do this.(TypeScript can support annotation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Java, we don’t have annotation in JavaScript, so we might need to use some magic trick to make one.&lt;br&gt;In our example, even though we know the formal parameters are correspond to our functions’ name. But our interpreter don’t know about this. When we write down the code below, there’s no differences between &lt;code&gt;CoffeeMaker1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CoffeeMaker2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;//function1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;CoffeeMaker1&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;grinder, heater, pump&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.blew = &lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        grinder.grind();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        heater.on();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        pump.pump();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &amp;#125;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;//function2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;CoffeeMaker2&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;a, b, c&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.blew = &lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        a.grind();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        b.on();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        c.pump();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &amp;#125;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can we make sure in our &lt;code&gt;CoffeeMaker&lt;/code&gt; we will invoke the right function? This is where the trick happen, &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically we just simply invoke &lt;code&gt;CoffeeMaker.toString()&lt;/code&gt;, then we will get the function in a string format. And then we can use regex get the parameters list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; FN_ARGS = &lt;span class=&quot;regexp&quot;&gt;/^function\s*[^\(]*\(\s*([^\(]*)\)/m&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; str = CoffeeMaker.toString();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; injectArr =  str.match(FN_ARGS);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.log(injectArr);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;//[&quot;function CoffeeMaker(grinder, heater, pump)&quot;, &quot;grinder, heater, pump&quot;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now we can easily pass our dependency into the CoffeeMaker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;37&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;38&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;41&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Injector&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.cache = [];&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Dependency Injection is kind of design pattern. Well, although it is not in the GOF’s design pattern list, but I think it is getting more and more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Why-we-need-Dependency-Injection&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Why-we-need-Dependency-Injection&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Why we need Dependency Injection?&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why we need Dependency Injection?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly let us think about why we need dependency injection. Suppose we have a function below,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;CoffeeMaker&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; grinder = &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Grinder();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; pump = Pump.getInstance();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; heater = app.get(&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;Heater&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.brew = &lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        grinder.grind();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        heater.on();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        pump.pump();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &amp;#125;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The hardest problem in leetcode, and it force me to read something new, maybe this is why we solve the problem in the online judge system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Valid-Number&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Valid-Number&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Valid Number&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Valid Number&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valid if a given string is numeric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot; 0.1&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;abc&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;1 a&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;2e10&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Analysis&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Analysis&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Analysis&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, regular expression must be a way to solve this problem. But I don’t think the recuiter would accept regex solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem is all about state and the transition which is how regular expression worked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finite State Automata&lt;br&gt;A finite-state machine or finite-state automatata, or simply a state machine, is a mathematial model of computation used to design both computer programs and sequential logic circuits. It is conceived as an abstract machine that can be in one of a finite number of states. &lt;strong&gt;The machine is in only one state at a time;&lt;/strong&gt;  – from Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Finite-state machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a word, to know whether a string is numeric we need to know all the states and the possible transition. And after spend some time we can get the list below,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1   + or -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2   number (0 - 9)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3   . (dot)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4   e or E (exponent)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5   others (includ space)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this possible inputs, we can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;State Diagram&lt;/a&gt; to describe all the valid and the transitions.&lt;br&gt;For example, from &lt;code&gt;state1&lt;/code&gt; it can be only transformed into &lt;code&gt;state2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;state3&lt;/code&gt;, which means &lt;code&gt;+3&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-.4&lt;/code&gt; are all valid numeric but &lt;code&gt;+e10&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+ 4&lt;/code&gt; are not.&lt;br&gt;To give a most complicated valid numeric expression should contains all states, &lt;code&gt;+0.42e-10&lt;/code&gt; should be the one.&lt;br&gt;So we can draw down the State Diagram below,&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TylerYang/leetcode/master/65.ValidNumber/validNumber.png&quot; alt=&quot;State Diagram&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this diagram, we can write down the pseudo code blow,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;int state = 0;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;boolean hasNumber = false;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;for(each char in String s)&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;

They are all base on &lt;strong&gt;Finite State Automata&lt;/strong&gt;, which is really worth a try. Here I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1438428554&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=algorithm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Algorithm (the 4th Edition)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in this book, the author give a very detail introduction of &lt;strong&gt;StateMachine&lt;/strong&gt; in chapter 5.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This should be one of the most insteresting algorithm problem I try to solve within this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the question,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Palindrome-PartitioningII&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Palindrome-PartitioningII&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Palindrome PartitioningII&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Palindrome PartitioningII&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.&lt;br&gt;Return the minimum cuts needs for a palindrome partitioning of s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, given s = “aab”,&lt;br&gt;Return &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; since the palindrome partitioning &lt;code&gt;[&amp;quot;aa&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; could be produced using 1 cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a id=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Analysis&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Analysis&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Analysis&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the minimum cut, of course backtracking can get an answer. To do it in a better way, &lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Programming&lt;/strong&gt; will be suit for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say, we want to know the minimum cut for string &lt;code&gt;s = &amp;quot;aabaabcb&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;a a b a a c b c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, we need to find out all the palindrome substring in it so that we can get the minimum cut. But we can reuse some part of the substring. For example, if we know &lt;code&gt;aba&lt;/code&gt; is a palindrome, to valid &lt;code&gt;aabaa&lt;/code&gt; we only need to make sure the first character equals to the last one.&lt;br&gt;So the first step is to find out all the substring which is palindrome.&lt;br&gt;We use 2 dimension array to store all the result. For String &lt;code&gt;s = &amp;quot;aabaabcb&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, substring s.substring(1, 3) is a palindrome, so we set &lt;code&gt;dp[1][3] = true&lt;/code&gt;, here is the java code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight java&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;[][] dp = &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;[s.length()][s.length()];&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; i = s.length() - &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;; i &amp;gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; i--) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; j = i; j &amp;lt; s.length(); j++) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(s.charAt(j) == s.charAt(i) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (j - i &amp;lt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; || dp[i + &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;][j - &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] == &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;)) dp[i][j] = &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after run this code, we get a two dimension array below,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually it is easy to get this 2d array, the trick is in the next step.&lt;br&gt;To get the minimum cut from it, we need to compare different combinations, e.g for string &lt;code&gt;abaacbc&lt;/code&gt; the minimun cut should be one of the combinations below,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;subStr.length() - 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1 + minCut(&amp;quot;baacbc&amp;quot;) //a is palindrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1 + minCut(&amp;quot;acbc&amp;quot;)   //aba is palindrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A navie idea is code it up with simply recursive call. Can we do it better? To get the min cut of &lt;code&gt;abaacbc&lt;/code&gt;, we need to know the min cut of &lt;code&gt;baacbc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;acbc&lt;/code&gt;. Then we know this is another &lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Programming&lt;/strong&gt; solution. In another word, to solve this problem, we need to use &lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Programming&lt;/strong&gt; two times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s create an one-dimension array, &lt;code&gt;minCut&lt;/code&gt;, each element stands for min cut of s.substring(i)&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight java&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;[] minCut = &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;[s.length() + &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]; &lt;span class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;//last should be &quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; i = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; i &amp;lt; minCut.length; i++) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    minCut[i] = minCut.length - i - &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;//[7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; i = s.length() - &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;; i &amp;gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; i--) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; j = i; j &amp;lt; s.length(); j++) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(dp[i][j] == &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;            minCut[i] = Math.min(minCut[i], &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; + minCut[j + &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; minCut[&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been doing the Google Challenge, and I found a very interesting algorithm problem. Here is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Reverse-a-Hash-Function-Level-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Reverse-a-Hash-Function-Level-3&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Reverse a Hash Function (Level 3)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reverse a Hash Function (Level 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The function takes a 16 byte input and gives a 16 byte output. It uses multiplication (*), bit-wise exclusive OR (XOR) and modulo (%) to calculate an element of the digest based on elements of the input message: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight java&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;digest [i] = ( (&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt; * message[i]) XOR message[i-&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]) % &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first element, the value of &lt;code&gt;message[-1]&lt;/code&gt; is 0.&lt;br&gt;For example, if &lt;code&gt;message[0] = 1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;message[1] = 129&lt;/code&gt;, then:&lt;br&gt;For &lt;code&gt;digest[0]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight java&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt; * message[&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;] = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt; XOR message[-&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt; % &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus &lt;code&gt;digest[0] = 129&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;For digest[1]:&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight java&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt;*message[&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;16641&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;16641&lt;/span&gt; XOR message[&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;] = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;16640&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;16640&lt;/span&gt; % &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus &lt;code&gt;digest[1] = 0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Write a function answer(digest) that takes &lt;strong&gt;an array of 16 integers&lt;/strong&gt; and returns another array of 16 that correspond to the unique message that created this digest. Since each value is a single byte, the values are &lt;strong&gt;0 to 255&lt;/strong&gt; for both message and digest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight java&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; list) [&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;49&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;81&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;121&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;144&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;169&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;196&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;225&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a id=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Analysis&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Analysis&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Analysis&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically this problem is about how to reverse this expression,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight java&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;digest [i] = ( (&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt; * message[i]) XOR message[i-&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]) % &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first moment I saw this problem, I was wondering maybe I can just simply move the modulo operator(%) to the right side, and then the &lt;code&gt;XOR&lt;/code&gt; operator. For &lt;code&gt;129 * message[i]&lt;/code&gt;, maybe I can use the forloop to find out the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;% 256&lt;/code&gt; we know it is only set a upperbound to our hash result, XOR &lt;code&gt;message[i - 1]&lt;/code&gt; will not affect the result of modulo(message[i - 1] is in the interleaving [0, 255]). which means&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;digest[i] = ((129 * message[i]) XOR message[i - 1]) % 256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;          = ((129 * message[i]) % 256) XOR message[i - 1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the expression below,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;a ^ b = c;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;c ^ b = a;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;c ^ a = b;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearently we know this will happen, if you want the approvement, &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/25/About-XOR-operator/&quot;&gt;here is another post about this.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know the value of &lt;code&gt;digest[i]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;message[i - 1]&lt;/code&gt;, so we get the expression below,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;digest[i] = ((129 * message[i]) % 256) XOR message[i - 1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;digest[i] XOR message[i - 1] = (129 * message[i]) % 256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the question become for x in [0, 255], y in [0, 255]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;(129 * x) % 256 = y //we know what is y (digest[i] ^ message[i - 1])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What is x ? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We don’t know it yet. Let us clear our mind and run these code in your chrome web developer tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; x = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; x &amp;lt;= &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;; x++) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;	&lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.log(&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;x:&quot;&lt;/span&gt; + x + &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;, result: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + (&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt; * x % &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the result, we will see in some number when we run this expression,&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;129 * x % 256&lt;/code&gt; it will equals to x. To be more clearly, let us run the javascript code into chrome dvp tool one more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; x = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; x &amp;lt;= &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;; x += &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;	&lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.log(&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;x:&quot;&lt;/span&gt; + x + &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;, result: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt; * x % &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; x = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;; x &amp;lt;= &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;; x += &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;	&lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.log(&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;x:&quot;&lt;/span&gt; + x + &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;, result: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt; * x % &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we know that when the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;code&gt;129 * x % 256&lt;/code&gt; will equals to &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. When &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ODD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the result start from 129 until it reach 255, then it start from 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very interesting fact about this express is, &lt;code&gt;129&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;256&lt;/code&gt; are very insteresting numbers, &lt;code&gt;129 == 256 / 2 + 1&lt;/code&gt;, Which means per two 129 we will get 258 and after mod 256 we only get &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;. when x is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, let’s say x is &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;129 * 4 % 256 = (129 * 2 + 129 * 2) % 256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;              = (256 + 2 + 256 + 2) % 256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;              = 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why when &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the result is equals to itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then how about &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ODD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;? Assumming &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is 5, we can get the result below,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;129 * 5 % 256 = (129 * 2 + 129 * 2 + 129) % 256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;              = (256 + 2 + 256 + 2 + 129) % 256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;              = 4 + 129 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;              = 5 + 128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ODD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, one thing we need to consider is, if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is larger than 128, this expression will smaller than 128, let’s say &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is 131&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;129 * 131 % 256 = (129 * 128 + 129 * 3) % 256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                = (128 * 128 + 128 + 256 + 2 + 129) % 256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                = (128 + 129 + 2) % 256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                = (256 + 3) % 256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                = 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now we can write down our pseudo code blow,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plain&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;if(digest[i] XOR message[i - 1] is EVEN) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;	//message[i] is EVEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;	message[i] = digest[i] ^ message[i - 1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125; else &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;	//message[i] is ODD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;	if(digest[i] &amp;gt; 128) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;		if(message[i - 1] &amp;gt; 128) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;			// 129 * message[i] % 256 &amp;lt; 128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;			// message[i] &amp;gt; 128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;			message[i] += 128;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;		&amp;#125; else &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;			// 129 * message[i] % 256 &amp;gt; 128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;			// message[i] &amp;lt; 128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;			message[i] -= 128;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;		&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;	&amp;#125; else &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;		if(message[i - 1] &amp;gt; 128) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;			// 129 * message[i] % 256 &amp;gt; 128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;			// message[i] &amp;lt; 128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;			message[i] += 128;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;		&amp;#125; else &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;			// 129 * message[i] % 256 &amp;lt; 128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;			// message[i] &amp;gt; 128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;			message[i] -= 128;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;		&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;	&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is Java Code,&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight java&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;class&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;[] reverseHash(&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;[] digest) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; prevM = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;[] message = &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;[digest.length];&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; i = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; i &amp;lt; digest.length; i++) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;            message[i] = tmp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;            &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(tmp % &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; == &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(digest[i] &amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;) &amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    message[i] += message[i - &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] &amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;128&lt;/span&gt; ?

It’s about some specify algorithm(e.g Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithm). This problem is only about the basic bit manipulation and some math stuff. At least, this problem tell me, it’s time to read the csapp one more time. : )&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been doing the Google Challenge, and I found a very interesting algorithm problem. Here is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Reverse-a-Hash-Function-Level-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Reverse-a-Hash-Function-Level-3&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Reverse a Hash Function (Level 3)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reverse a Hash Function (Level 3)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The function takes a 16 byte input and gives a 16 byte output. It uses multiplication (*), bit-wise exclusive OR (XOR) and modulo (%) to calculate an element of the digest based on elements of the input message: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight java&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;digest [i] = ( (&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt; * message[i]) XOR message[i-&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]) % &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first element, the value of &lt;code&gt;message[-1]&lt;/code&gt; is 0.&lt;br&gt;For example, if &lt;code&gt;message[0] = 1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;message[1] = 129&lt;/code&gt;, then:&lt;br&gt;For &lt;code&gt;digest[0]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight java&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt; * message[&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;] = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt; XOR message[-&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt; % &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus &lt;code&gt;digest[0] = 129&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;For digest[1]:&lt;br&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight java&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;129&lt;/span&gt;*message[&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;] = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;16641&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;16641&lt;/span&gt; XOR message[&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;] = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;16640&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;16640&lt;/span&gt; % &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;256&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appearently when we  &lt;code&gt;a ^ b&lt;/code&gt;, their public bits are all set to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;(The 0th) and the bits only exist in b or a is already save into the c(The 2th from a and the 8th from b).&lt;br&gt;So At this moment &lt;code&gt;b ^ c&lt;/code&gt; will equal to ‘bits only exist in a and bits exist in both &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; which is &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;‘(The 0th from &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and the 2th from &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
