<p>So the value of values, who here works in IT.<br>What is that mean? What is it stand for IT?<br>Information technology. SO what do we mean when we say information? As you may know for my other keynoted, all I want to make my<br>kwynotes my dictionary, is my dictionary has all the answers. My dictionary says information is base on the word inform, which means<br>to convey knowledge via facts and the purpose of that is to give shape to the mind. And information is just those facts.That is what<br>information is. Information is fact. </p>
<p>So what is a fact? A fact is the place where information store. And what is great about that is there is a place for every piece of information.<br>And facts are operations, like get and set and you may have other operations. And those operation control how facts can change.<br>The other great things about fact is it’s easy to convey them.To convey a fact is just convey its location.</p>
<p>How many people are uncomfortable right now? I am, this is not true right? This is wrong. Everything I just said is wrong.Dead wrong,<br>and you should be uncomfortable.This is not the facts are.</p>
<p>So our facts are places,well, what’s the place? Again back to the dictionary, a place is a particular portion of space. And the space is a more<br>important word, we gonna dig into later.And in particular the part of the place that matters are the fact it’s sort of delimited. right? There is<br>the specificity to location, name via place or vice versa. And we know about places, we have good examples of places of everyday work in progarming.<br>Memory address are places, disk sector are places. Addresses, we can go to them, substitude their contents with other contents.And we are very familiar with<br>this notion of place. And i think it’s quite  important to think about whether or not with this memory address in this location we are actually building<br>the information systems that earn about information we just find it. ??<br>In particluar, we use memory and we use objects, typically, specially at this contents. And mutable objects are nothing more than abstraction over places.<br>their little abstraction over places. Specially, well in partically the mutable objects.and they have methods just like the thing I talk before about fact.<br>having methods object have methods. And this is the core thing we are building systems on it. On the other side, on the durably side, we have same kind of notion.</p>
<p>we have tables documents, records, all of them have the places. all of them have update inotaion, the notion of going into the place and set it into a value .<br>These are undependings from which we build systems. but we are sort of making abstraction on top of them.But don’t hide what they are about.</p>
<p>And I have word for this or term for this, I call it PLOP, Plaec oriented programming.Which is what this is. And you can tell what’s going on.Because everytime the new<br>information replace old information.You are doing the place oriented programming.There are reasons we are doing the place-oriented programming. Because way back the<br>early days of computers, we have to do place oriented programming. I saw a guy stills gave a great talk is talking about working you konw, building the great system<br>on computer that have 4 kilo words of memory.And every piece of memory, you knew the address, she know the even number of memory started at 2000 or use for jump table.<br>The number of the address here are use for data And other part of the memory here are use for code.Sometimes it used for more than one thing, for example, right now,<br>no one use this for code we can use it for data, vise versa. You have to do it. right, there isn’t enough compacity to do anything else. Computer memory is really small.<br>dist is very small.everything is very expensive, so we adopt it an approach to programming that was base around the manipulation of palces, totally make sense. And the keyword,<br>they are in the key aspect it make sense, it used to make sense, those limitations are gone. In the time I’ve been doing the programming, the capacity of these two have<br>increase a million faults. A MILLION FAULTS.What other thing in life, you know, have the same fact about it?Remain true when the sidzes of something change by a million fault.</p>
<p>Magic trick call was million times bigger than this. What rules would still be applyed?What characters would still be true?<br>But yet, we are retaining decision that make thing much much smaller. And moving forward with them.</p>
<p>So why is PLOP still rules? The key question here.Right? we are talking about the Place-oriented programming, we often talk about the two things, memory and records.<br>these have meanning before we have computer, and we are taking them over. We said, memory means addresses in RAM chips, records mean you konw slots in database’s tables. And worse<br>than just taken over these words, coz obviously there is limitions to these words in the analogies roughly whole,right? </p>
<p>The problems is we’ve now been doing this for so long. We believe that our own myths about what this is mean. But we should go back to the fact of memory of method right?The fact<br>of memory is that it’s open system.If your friend gets a new email address, right? that doesn’t go into your brain.And find your friend’s email address cell and replace the email<br>address in that part you konw that’s no runs??? in your brain. that’s not how brains work.that’s not how memory works. Memory essentially and open system, and associated system.<br>it is not an addressed base system. </p>
<p>Same thing, record keeping. We use to keep record before we have computers. What do we do?You know we took out the stone tablet and chew all the things,<br>we took out the pepile and wrote things down. When we have new information, what do we do?We didn’t go and l?et smooth over the marble and choose the new stuff. We didnt’ go the prepiles? and<br>take out a racers and things like that. People build and accounting systems, they didn’t use the racer either. What they use double entry ccounting, ledger based countting. They only<br>make correcting entries. They did not go back with the racers. Not the way things work before we had computers.So this talk is about values.7:27</p>
<p>So another term we should define, And again, we just go back to the dictionary. There are some interesting definition for value. Right? First is relative worth. And relave is end up being very<br>critical aspect for values.right, because the next thing is the one we probally most familiar with the person computers. Right, coz this next definition is the one applies to like 42 right. it’s<br>a magnitude it’s a number. it’s something we use to measure somethign else. Nah notion of value, I think it’s the one we mostly readily able to adapt. And again, the bigger notion of value is about<br>meanning and comparability and about relative worth. That’s the bigger notion of value, because when you measure something, you have to measure in term of something else. It does absolute measurement.</p>
<p>Some the comparsion part is important, So the question right now is, is String a value? How many people give this?(raise the hand)  I love doing the answer the question by rasing the hands, but not everybody hvae<br>the hands, appearantly. How many people think string is not a value. How many people think it depends? You always wait for the depends ? right? that’s the best answer. You hold that for it.Right? what is<br>it depends on?<br>is it immutable ?right? if the string is mutable, it’s a value, if the string is immutable, it’s not a value.How many people work the programming language would still do what string is mutable?<br>How many people want to go back? No, we don’t like this.And it ends up that, this equality notion of value, coz right now, the string doesn’t measure something right ?It’s not manitude or amount, it doen’t<br>correspond to that definition.But it ends that the mutable string is a comparable thing. And comparability is where we derive our ability to do logic. and to make decisiio.And to we can say, is this<br>the same was yesterday ? is it greater or less than what it was ? Is the string label this thing correctly you know according to my understanding of it. Or anything we do, with information. That comparability and<br>equality test sort of bottom, now goes back to another notion of value. We really don’t want to go back.</p>
<p>So now we want to sort of talk about the values, it’s not from the dictionaly definition.  but very  specifically, in term of what we do in programming. And there are lot’s of new answer to this spec de? the purpose<br>to this talk if giving it half an hour. I’m just gonna to focus on two, valuls are immutable, and values are semantically transparent. And the purpose of the values is it expose to you, so that you can do the<br>comparasion and equality test. Values is not about ecapsulate something into your method, and doing thing. The value is saying, compare me to something else.I’m telling you what my precise meaning and signicant is.<br>Significant is write on the label, write on the outside. </p>
<p>So the reason give this talk about is the value propositions of values. what makes values good.originally this talk is going to be an hour long , so this is gonna to be a little bit fast. But there’s bunch of characteristics<br>that the value are valuable.The first is the value can be shared. Right, if you have the value, you have the immutable thing. Can you give it to somebody else and not worry?Yes, you don’t have to worry. Do they have to<br>worry about you now , coz both of you are sharing the same value. Anybody have to worry?No. So the value can be shared, that’s very very valuable.</p>
<p>Value supports reproducible results. Right, if you define a function in terms of value. Everytime may call that function you get the same answer. Yes. if you define a fucntion in terms of places. Everytime you run that function<br>you will get same answer ? NO! Right? in terms of what’s is the place ? Right? reproducible result really matters.They allow you to run tests. And reproducible tests. How many people now runnig test now in places? They can’t<br>tell you anything. Can’t tell you anything, they all contional on your ability to bring that ‘place’ to the same place. To the same value. Another critical aspect to value is that they are easy to fabricate, you can make up<br>the values from scratch in any progaramming language quite readily. Can you make a string in any programming language? yes. Can you make a list of string? sure. list of number, yes ,list of list of numbers, a map of list of numbers.<br>yes. can I make it insance of your fancy interface in any other language?No, it’s not easy to fabracate that, it’s not easy to make programs that write programs. it’s not easy to write program that write tests, if your progarms<br>are not based around values. So the fact that those are easy to fabricate is important. </p>
<p>Alright, values are language independent.So I just talk about that already. The notion of string or number or map.This has noting to do with the programming language. The thing I just said, nothing at all right?Nor any of the aggregate those<br>things have nothing to do with that. They are generic.These ideas, the notion of values are generic.And I think it’s somehing that we don’t thing about of another in our programming designed to our system, but the actual cost of specificity.<br>We love specificity, we use java every new idea gets a new class.Every new thing gets a new thing. What’s the cost that happen? You get this explosion of code  just a tremendous explosion of code.<br>obvious was worth suport revies the exact opposite thing especially in type languages. You get very little reuse coz you make a new thing every time.<br>And what is more code mean? More code equal more bugs. Another interesting thing about values is value are aggrigate to values. This is something I really want you to focus on. We talk about the 42, we talk about the string, we talk about the<br>atomic thing.But the list of immutable things. it’s itself and immutable thing, so on and so forth. As you build aggrigates, those bigger things are also values. And I think we tend to stop, we say of course strings to be immutable. But the<br>immutable collections, booo (no, I don’t want it), I can’t even comprehend it. But you should, right? It has all the same desirable attributes that the immutable string did. nobody here wants program with mutable strings anymore. Why do you<br>want program with mutable collections anymore. You shouldn’t. And is really important a benefits you get from doing this.For instance, compare to object if you have an object and you want to share, what do you have to do?  Right? just find the object<br>find the interface,  then you have to do what? What if in concurrent environment, what do you have to have to that object? Some sort of locking policy ? right? very very  difficulte thing in fact a lot of languages don’t give you any rsources to<br>define it well. But if you done that, and there’s also other kind of the problems, like how do you copy it? What is the cloning sematic? Once you done that work, you done that work for every of your classes.And now you build something that is composite<br>of those things. Do you get a lock policy for combinding them? No! It all falls away, you have do all over again. This composite for all these things for which I have lock policy, now no longer have a lock policy, I have to come up with the new one. has<br>come up the new cloning policy , and everything else do over again. </p>
<p>Values aggregates to values, all the benefits apply to aggregate. There are other benefits we get from aggregate, we see this all the time. Values are easy to convey. If I have a piece of information I think it’s useful. I can send you that values, and<br>I’ve know I have communicated to you what I was seeing, if I see something interesting and I communicate to you the place where I say what I actually convey to you?Nothing, not the information that’s for sure. Coz you go to that place, you saw totally<br>different thing than what I saw. It works in other way as well. When I wanna perceive something. If it’s a value I could take my time and look at it, right? especially for the set of values, right, if it’s composite thing. 16:58</p>
